# Phase 1 Tasks: In-Memory Python Console App

This document breaks down the specific tasks required to complete Phase 1.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] **T1.1:** Initialize a Python project using `uv`.
- [x] **T1.2:** Create the project directory structure:
  - `src/` for the main application code.
  - `specs/` for specification files.
  - `specs/features/` for feature-specific specs.

### 2. Specification
- [x] **T2.1:** Create the specification file for the "Add Task" feature (`specs/features/add-task.md`).
- [x] **T2.2:** Create the specification file for the "View Tasks" feature (`specs/features/view-tasks.md`).
- [x] **T2.3:** Create the specification file for the "Update Task" feature (`specs/features/update-task.md`).
- [x] **T2.4:** Create the specification file for the "Delete Task" feature (`specs/features/delete-task.md`).
- [x] **T2.5:** Create the specification file for the "Mark Task as Complete" feature (`specs/features/complete-task.md`).

### 3. Implementation (using AI)
- [x] **T3.1:** Generate the Python code for the core application logic and data structures based on the specs.
- [x] **T3.2:** Implement the "Add Task" functionality by prompting Claude Code with its spec.
- [x] **T3.3:** Implement the "View Tasks" functionality.
- [x] **T3.4:** Implement the "Update Task" functionality.
- [x] **T3.5:** Implement the "Delete Task" functionality.
- [x] **T3.6:** Implement the "Mark Task as Complete" functionality.
- [x] **T3.7:** Create the main application loop to handle user input and orchestrate the features.

### 4. Documentation
- [x] **T4.1:** Write the `README.md` file, including:
  - Project description.
  - Setup instructions (`uv sync`).
  - Usage instructions for the console app.
- [x] **T4.2:** Write the `CLAUDE.md` file, explaining how to use the specs with Claude Code to generate the application code.

### 5. Verification
- [x] **T5.1:** Manually test all five features to ensure they work as expected.
  - Can tasks be added?
  - Can the task list be viewed correctly?
  - Can tasks be updated?
  - Can tasks be deleted?
  - Can a task's completion status be toggled?
- [x] **T5.2:** Review the code for clarity and structure.
- [x] **T5.3:** Confirm all deliverables for Phase 1 are complete and ready for submission.
