# RESTful API Design Skills

This document outlines the key skills and knowledge required for designing RESTful APIs in Phase 2 of this project.

## Core Concepts

*   **REST Principles:** Understanding the core principles of REST, including statelessness, client-server architecture, and uniform interface.
*   **Resource Naming:** Designing clear and consistent resource URIs (e.g., `/users`, `/users/{id}`).
*   **HTTP Methods:** Correctly using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to perform actions on resources.
*   **Status Codes:** Using appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).
*   **Request and Response Formats:** Designing clear and consistent request and response bodies using JSON.

## Advanced Concepts

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Designing secure API authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT and OAuth2.
*   **Versioning:** Implementing a versioning strategy for the API to avoid breaking changes.
*   **Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering:** Designing APIs that support pagination, sorting, and filtering of results.
*   **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):** Including links in API responses to allow clients to discover related actions.
*   **API Documentation:** Writing clear and comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
