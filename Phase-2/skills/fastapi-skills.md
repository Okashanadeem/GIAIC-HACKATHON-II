# FastAPI Skills

This document outlines the key skills and knowledge required for professional FastAPI development in Phase 2 of this project.

## Core Concepts

*   **Path Operations:** Defining API endpoints using decorators (`@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.).
*   **Request and Response Models:** Using Pydantic models for request body validation and response serialization.
*   **Data Validation:** Leveraging Pydantic for automatic data validation and error handling.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Understanding and using FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing dependencies and reusing code.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing security measures using FastAPI's security utilities, including OAuth2 and JWT tokens.

## Advanced Concepts

*   **Database Integration:** Integrating with databases like PostgreSQL using ORMs like SQLModel or SQLAlchemy.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Writing asynchronous code using `async` and `await` for improved performance.
*   **Middleware:** Creating and using middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and authentication.
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configuring CORS to allow requests from different origins (e.g., the Next.js frontend).
*   **Testing:** Writing unit and integration tests for FastAPI applications using tools like Pytest.
