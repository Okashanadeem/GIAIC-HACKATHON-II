# Monorepo Management Skills

This document outlines the key skills and knowledge required for managing a monorepo in Phase 2 of this project.

## Core Concepts

*   **Monorepo Structure:** Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of a monorepo and how to structure a project with multiple applications (e.g., frontend and backend).
*   **Workspace Management:** Using tools like npm, yarn, or pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies across multiple packages in a monorepo.
*   **Shared Code:** Creating shared packages for code that is used by multiple applications (e.g., a shared types package).
*   **Build and Test:** Setting up build and test scripts that can be run for individual packages or for the entire monorepo.
*   **IDE Setup:** Configuring your IDE (e.g., VS Code) to work effectively with a monorepo, including support for TypeScript path aliases.

## Advanced Concepts

*   **Code Generation:** Using code generation tools to scaffold new packages and applications within the monorepo.
*   **CI/CD:** Setting up a CI/CD pipeline that can build and deploy individual applications from the monorepo.
*   **Dependency Visualization:** Using tools to visualize the dependency graph of the monorepo.
*   **Linting and Formatting:** Enforcing consistent code style across the entire monorepo with tools like ESLint and Prettier.
