# Full-Stack Development Skills

This document outlines the key skills and knowledge required for full-stack development in Phase 2 of this project.

## Core Concepts

*   **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Understanding how the frontend and backend communicate with each other, including making API requests from the frontend and handling them on the backend.
*   **Data Flow:** Understanding how data flows through the application, from the database to the backend to the frontend and back again.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing authentication and authorization across the full stack, ensuring that users can only access the data and functionality they are permitted to.
*   **Error Handling:** Handling errors gracefully across the full stack, from database errors to API errors to UI errors.
*   **Development Workflow:** Establishing an efficient development workflow for working on both the frontend and backend simultaneously.

## Advanced Concepts

*   **DevOps:** Understanding the basics of DevOps, including setting up a CI/CD pipeline, managing infrastructure, and monitoring the application.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks across the full stack.
*   **Security:** Understanding common security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) and how to prevent them.
*   **Scalability:** Designing and building applications that can handle a growing number of users and data.
